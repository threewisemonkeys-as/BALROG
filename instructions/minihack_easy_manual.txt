- **Eating (Inventory Items):** To eat an item from inventory, use the `eat` command. This is a two-step process: first the `eat` command, then a single character for the inventory item when prompted (e.g., "What do you want to eat? [a-z or ?*]"). 
- **Eating (Ground Items):** When an edible item is on the ground, a prompt "There is an X here; eat it? [ynq]" may appear. In this specific scenario, input 'y' or 'n' (single character) as an action to respond. 
- **Satiation and Choking:** Eating food can restore health and lead to a "satiated" state. Eating while already satiated will result in choking and death.
- **Wearing Armor (Equipping):** To wear an armor item (including rings and amulets, not just body armor), use the `puton` command, then select the inventory letter of the item when prompted.
- **Armor Slots and Management:** Armor items occupy specific slots. You generally cannot wear two items of the same *slot type* simultaneously (e.g., two robes or a robe and a cloak). To wear a new armor item occupying the *same slot type* as an already equipped item, the old item must first be `remove`d.
- **Removing Armor:** To remove an armor item, use the `remove` command, then select the inventory letter of the equipped item when prompted.
- **Incorrect Input During Item Prompts:** Incorrect input (e.g., 'l' or 'k' when not prompted as an inventory item, or a full command instead of a single character) when prompted for an inventory item during `puton`, `eat`, or `remove` can cause the game to prematurely "quit" or result in an unintended game termination.
- **Applying Items:** To apply certain items (e.g., wands, pick-axes, ruby ring, certain potions like levitation potions, combat boots, tiger eye ring), use the `apply` command. This often requires a direction or a follow-up input to specify the item or its target.
- **`apply`ing a Pick-axe:** `apply`ing a pick-axe in a direction can be used to break through doors or certain walls. This is likely a two-step command: `apply` then the inventory item, then potentially a direction.
- **Zapping Wands:** To zap wands, use the `zap` command, usually followed by a direction. Zapping wands (e.g., 'wand of cold' or an 'iridium wand') can have various effects, including solidifying lava. Zapping a wand incorrectly (e.g., at solid stone or self, or when not aimed at a valid target) can cause damage or have no effect ("The bolt of cold bounces!").
- **Movement:** Moving is done via directional commands: `north`, `south`, `east`, `west`, `northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`.
- **Impassable Terrain:** Moving into "#" or "solid stone" (or other impassable terrain like `---` or mapped walls) is not possible and wastes a turn, often resulting in "It's a wall" or "It's solid stone" messages. An agent must learn to interpret these non-passable symbols correctly. The '#' symbol usually indicates a solid wall, not a traversable door.
- **Combat Initiation:** Moving onto a tile occupied by a monster initiates combat. The agent attacks the monster but generally remains in its original position unless the monster is defeated.
- **Descending Stairs:** To descend stairs, you must be physically standing *on the stairs symbol* ('>' for stairs down), then use the `down` command. 
- **Opening Standard Doors:** To open a standard door, you must be adjacent to the door. This is a two-step command: first `open`, then a direction (e.g., `east`).
- **Dealing with Locked Doors:** To deal with locked doors, `kick` can be used. This is also a two-step command: first `kick`, then a direction (e.g., `east`).
- **Prayer:** Prayer is performed using the `pray` command. 
- **Low Health (HP) Management:** Low health (HP) requires management, typically through eating food items or using potions. Failure to correctly execute multi-step commands for healing can lead to death.
- **Multi-step Commands (General):** Many commands that logically require a secondary input (such as a direction for `open`, `kick`, `zap`, or `apply`; or an inventory item for `eat`, `puton`, `remove`) are implemented as a two-step process in the game interface. The initial command word (e.g., `open`) is sent first, followed by the secondary input (e.g., `east` or 'a') as a separate action on the next turn, *even if no explicit prompt is visually displayed by the game*. Failing to adhere to this two-step process by sending "command + input" as a single action string (e.g., "open east") often results in "Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Retry", "invalid action", or similar non-progress messages.
- **Picking Up Items:** To pick up an item, you must be standing *on the same tile* as the item, then use the `pickup` command.
- **Ambiguous Game Feedback:** Sometimes, the language observation feedback can be misleading (e.g., "You see no door there" when a '+' symbol (door) is visually present, or a "closed door" when it's actually locked). In such cases, agents should prioritize direct visual map observations and systematic experimentation (e.g., trying `kick` if `open` fails, or directly moving into the tile) over ambiguous text.
