- Zap a wand to clear through the lava.
- First execute the zap action, then choose the wand and finally use it in the direction of the lava.
- Selecting zap, wand and direction will be three seperate sequential actions.
- After crossing the lava, keep exploring east until you find the stairs.
- Zapping a wand on walls is dangerous and could kill you, only use it to cool lava.

- Once you see the stairs to go down (>), go towards them.
